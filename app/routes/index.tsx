          I come from a music background in the greater Los Angelos area. Having started and played in an indie pop/rock band for 8 years with my childhood friend. Durring a difficult time in my life and music carrer I was given an invitation to make music for a video game. As I began learning the audio middleware I was eager to learn more about how the game was being made. I was quickly taken under the wing of the developer who became my mentor and is now a dear friend. My bond with my friends is great and I am loved by those around me. Those that understand my weeknesses and my strengths. Music and Programming have played pivitol roles in my life and without them I do not know where I would be.
